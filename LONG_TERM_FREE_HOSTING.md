- Best free tier if accessible
- No spin-downs

## 🎯 My Strong Recommendation

**Use Cyclic.sh** - It's:
- ✅ Free forever (no expiration)

The spin-down isn't a big deal for Telegram bots - they wake up when users interact.

## Quick Migration from Fly.io to Cyclic

1. **Sign up**: https://cyclic.sh
2. **Connect GitHub** repo
3. **Set root**: `backend`
4. **Copy all env vars** from Fly.io
5. **Deploy** (2 minutes)
6. **Update Vercel** with new URL
7. **Test** Telegram bot

**Total time**: 10 minutes

---

## Alternative: Keep Fly.io + Add Payment Later

If you want to keep Fly.io:
- Use it for 7 days (free trial)
- Then add payment method (Pay-as-You-Go)
- Only pay for what you use (could be $0-5/month)
- Still very cheap

But **Cyclic.sh is completely free forever**, so that's better if you want zero cost.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Sign up for Cyclic.sh** (takes 1 minute)
2. **Deploy your backend** (takes 5 minutes)
3. **Update Vercel** with new backend URL
4. **Test everything**
5. **You're done** - free forever! 🎉
